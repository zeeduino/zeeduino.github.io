                <span class="text-info">Arduino-XC</span> stands for "Arduino across controllers".
                </p>
                <p>
                Or something like that.
                </p>

                <p>
                Arduino runs on Atmel AVR (8-bit) and Atmel SAM (32-bit) controllers.
                </p>

                <p>
                There are ports to few others like STM32 from ST (Leaflabs Maple) and PIC32 from Microchip (chipKIT32).
                </p>
                <p>
                If you want Arduino to run on your preferred controller, you have to roll up your sleeves and dig through Arduino code looking for clues on what, how and where to change, implement and code.
                </p>

                <p>
                Which is really not that hard. It just takes time. And patience.

                <p><span class="text-info">Arduino-XC</span> is a shot on making this porting process a walk in the park. Or just a light jogging.</p>

                <p>First chip that Arduino is ported to using Arduino-XC is LPC1347 from NXP.</p>

                <p>We ported Arduino to our (currently) favourite chip.</p>
