              <p>
              Zeeduino-XC is, in essence, a cleaned up, organized and layered Wiring/Arduino code.
              </p>

              <p>
              Entire code is divided into 3 distinct parts:
              <ul>              
                <li>Zeeduino implementation of Wiring/Arduino functions and core classes</li>
                <li>Controller specific code</li>
                <li>An abstraction layer (Board API and mappers) which connects those two</li>
              </ul>              
              </p>

              <p>
              The whole thing goes like this:
              <ol>
                <li>First you pick the best controller in the world. Ever. Period.</li>
                <li>Then you implement Board API functions and mapper structures.</li>
                <li>Compile and run Arduino/Wiring code on your controller (and on whatever board it is soldered to)</li>
                <li>Use hundreds of Arduino/Wiring libraries in your projects</li>
              </ol>              
              </p>

              <p>
              Step 4 is optional. You can write all those libraries yourself if you hate helping yourself with other people's work they offer you for free.
              </p>
              <p>
              I wrote all those libraries from scratch just because I can. You shouldn't do that. I love when people help me with their work, and I love doing the same for others. Thus, Zeeduino-XC.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Here is a simple diagram to show a basic concept of Zeeduino-XC:

              <div class="well well-sm">
              <p class="text-warning">
                Ok, where's the catch?
              </p>
              </div>

              <p>
              I dunno. Take a look at this a bit more detailed list of steps you need to do to port Wiring/Arduino to your controller, and to then take the advantage of all those libraries:
              <ul>
                <li>First you pick the best controller in the world. Ever. Period.</li>
                <li>Then you make sure you know how to program in C for that controller.</li>
                <li>Also make sure you have development tools used for development on that controller.</li>
                <li>It helps, a lot!, if there's a some sort of support code library for the controller.</li>
                <li>Now you sit down and start typing really fast and precise on your keyboard.</li>
                <li>With this fast typing, you aim to implement Board API functions so they work on your controller.</li>
                <li>You then adapt mapper structures to support your controller's pins and pin features, and the board the controller is on (you've got the board, right?)</li>
                <li>compile and run your first Wiring/Arduino program on your controller (and the board)</li>
              </ul>              
              </p>

              <div class="well well-sm">
              <p class="text-warning">
                Oh, right, there's the catch! &#x1F60B; <!-- img src="img/1f60b.png" height="20px" -->
              </p>
              </div>

              <p>
              Now, that may seem like a bit more work than I promised, but it is not. Compared to what you have to do if you start porting from scratch, this is a piece of cake. It is even faster and easier if you have an example of how it's been done already, which you can use as a reference point.

              You can download (or clone the git repo) <a href="https://github.com/zeeduino/zeeduino-xc-core" target="_blank">Zeeduino-XC source</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zeeduino/zeeduino-xc-hal-lpc13xx" target="_blank">Zeeduino-XC for lpc13xx port</a>. And you should. Then take a look at how lpc13xx port is implemented and repeat the same thing. It's not that hard. Honestly.

              <p>
              It's Zeeduino-XC.
              </p>

              <p>
              It's a wider and bigger playground.
